# Runtime Performance And Transport

## Scenario: Socket HTTP Transport

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing Gemini upstream transport, socket pooling, response body parsing, compression handling, or fetch fallback behavior.

### 2. Signatures

- `httpFetch(url, { method, headers, body, bodyLength, timeoutMs, socket, signal, cfg, acceptCompressed })` is the unified upstream entrypoint.
- `socketHttp(connect, url, { method, headers, body, bodyLength, timeoutMs, signal, keepAlive, pool, acceptCompressed })` owns HTTP/1.1 over `cloudflare:sockets`.
- `createSocketPool()`, `getDefaultSocketPool()`, and `closeIdleSocketPool(pool?)` own reusable idle sockets.
- `parseHttpChunkSizeLine(line: Uint8Array)` returns a safe integer chunk size or `-1`.

### 3. Contracts

- `httpFetch` should prefer socket transport when enabled and available, then fall back to `fetch` only for non-abort socket failures that occur before an upstream response status is exposed.
- Abort errors must not fall back to `fetch`; they must preserve request cancellation.
- Errors with upstream response metadata, such as `upstreamStatus`, must not fall back because the request may already have reached Gemini.
- `httpFetch` defaults socket `acceptCompressed` to `true` for `GET` and `false` for other methods unless explicitly provided.
- `socketHttp` sends `Accept-Encoding: gzip` only when `acceptCompressed` is true and `DecompressionStream("gzip")` is supported. Otherwise it sends `identity`.
- Streaming request bodies must provide a safe integer `bodyLength`. Socket transport uses it for `Content-Length` and writes chunks sequentially; fetch transport may use fixed-length Worker streams.
- Socket fallback with a streaming request body is allowed only before socket transport starts reading the body stream. Once the body stream has been read or written, do not retry through `fetch` because the body is no longer safely replayable.
- When a supported gzip response is decoded, remove `content-encoding` and `content-length` from the response headers exposed to callers.
- Unsupported or unsolicited compressed responses must remain raw bytes; do not construct unsupported decompression streams.
- Chunked response parsing must accept valid chunk extensions such as `5;foo=bar`, reject invalid hex, reject unsafe integer sizes, and tolerate split chunk-size lines across socket reads.
- Keep-alive sockets are pooled per origin, capped by `SOCKET_KEEP_ALIVE_MAX_IDLE_PER_ORIGIN`, and expire after `SOCKET_KEEP_ALIVE_IDLE_MS`.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- `cloudflare:sockets` unavailable -> `httpFetch` uses normal `fetch`.
- Socket connection/read/write error before upstream response status and request not aborted -> `httpFetch` logs safe metadata and falls back to `fetch`.
- Socket error with `upstreamStatus` metadata -> no fallback; propagate the socket error.
- `signal.aborted` or socket abort error -> throw abort, no fallback.
- `acceptCompressed=true`, gzip support present, gzip response -> caller sees decompressed body and no compression headers.
- `acceptCompressed=true`, gzip support absent -> request advertises `identity`; a gzip response remains raw.
- Chunk size line `5;foo=bar` -> parse as `5`.
- Chunk size line `a ;ext=1`, `Z`, or an unsafe integer -> stream error with `socket: invalid chunk size`.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: add a new response parser behavior in `socket.ts` and cover both split-buffer and normal-buffer reads.
- Base: socket transport preserves method, headers, body, timeout, auth cookies, model selection, and file references when falling back through `httpFetch`.
- Bad: fall back to anonymous or header-stripped fetch after a socket failure.
- Bad: send `Accept-Encoding: gzip` from socket code when the runtime cannot build a gzip `DecompressionStream`.
- Bad: parse chunk sizes with `parseInt(TEXT_DECODER.decode(line), 16)` without validating the full size token.

### 6. Tests Required

- Unit test `parseHttpChunkSizeLine` for valid extensions, invalid hex, whitespace edge cases, and unsafe sizes.
- Unit test socket gzip decoding when `CompressionStream` and `DecompressionStream` are present.
- Unit test unsupported decompression behavior by patching `DecompressionStream` away.
- Unit test keep-alive reuse and expiry/cap behavior after changing socket pooling.
- Run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:arch`, `pnpm unit`, and `pnpm smoke` after changing transport fallback or socket response parsing.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
const sizeText = TEXT_DECODER.decode(line).trim().split(";")[0] || "";
const chunkSize = parseInt(sizeText, 16);
```

#### Correct

```typescript
const chunkSize = parseHttpChunkSizeLine(line);
if (chunkSize < 0) throw new Error("socket: invalid chunk size");
```

## Scenario: Runtime Config And Bounded JSON Reads

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing environment config parsing, config cache keys, request body size guards, generated-image hydration, or JSON response helpers.

### 2. Signatures

- `CONFIG_ENV_KEYS` lists every environment key that affects `getConfig`.
- `CONFIG_ENV_KEYS` also defines the ordered fields captured by the structured config snapshot.
- `getConfig(env)` returns a cached `RuntimeConfig` only when the current watched values match the stored snapshot.
- `REQUEST_BODY_MAX_BYTES` maps to `RuntimeConfig.request_body_max_bytes`, defaults to `16777216`, and accepts integers from `1` through `104857600`.
- `requestContentLength(request)` returns a safe decimal byte length or `null`.
- `readJsonRequest(request, { maxBodyBytes, oversizedError })` reads UTF-8 JSON objects with optional bounded body size.
- `jsonTextResponse(body, status, extra)` returns an already-serialized JSON body.
- `hydrateGeneratedImages(...)` bounds each generated image to 16 MiB and aggregate decoded image bytes to 48 MiB by default.

### 3. Contracts

- Add every new environment variable consumed by `getConfig` to `CONFIG_ENV_KEYS`; otherwise cached configs can go stale.
- Do not cache config solely by env object identity. Cloudflare-style env objects may be reused and mutated in tests or local harnesses, so `getConfig` must compare every watched value before returning a cached result.
- Store primitive watched values directly in the snapshot. Do not concatenate or serialize secret-bearing strings such as `GEMINI_COOKIE`, `SAPISID`, or string-form `API_KEYS` on cache hits.
- Snapshot supported composite values by content. Array-form `API_KEYS` uses a shallow copied snapshot and must invalidate the cache after in-place item replacement, append, removal, or length changes.
- `requestContentLength` accepts only safe base-10 integer strings after trimming; invalid, signed, fractional, or unsafe values return `null`.
- `readJsonRequest` must reject `Content-Length > maxBodyBytes` before reading the stream.
- When the streamed body exceeds `maxBodyBytes`, cancel the reader and return the configured 413 error before UTF-8 decoding or JSON parsing.
- The JSON budget includes inline Base64 text. Multipart image edits do not use `REQUEST_BODY_MAX_BYTES`; they remain governed by `GENERIC_FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` and multipart overhead.
- If a valid `Content-Length` is present and within limit, preallocate that size; if the stream exceeds the declared length, fall back to chunk merging while still enforcing `maxBodyBytes`.
- Use `jsonTextResponse` when the caller already has a serialized JSON string and must avoid an extra `JSON.stringify`.
- Generated-image hydration validates content length and streamed bytes before Base64 conversion, decrements aggregate budget by decoded byte length, cancels overflowing readers, and preserves the source URL when a budget is exceeded.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Reused env object changes `LOG_REQUESTS=false` to `LOG_REQUESTS=true` -> `getConfig` returns `true`.
- Reused env object mutates `API_KEYS[1]` or appends a key -> `getConfig` reparses and returns the new list.
- New env key used by config but missing from `CONFIG_ENV_KEYS` -> stale-cache bug; add the key and a cache regression test.
- `Content-Length: 1000`, `maxBodyBytes: 999` -> 413 before body read.
- Chunked body grows from 900 to 1001 bytes with `maxBodyBytes: 1000` -> cancel reader and return 413 using `1001 bytes > 1000`.
- Generated image exceeds its individual or aggregate budget -> cancel its reader and preserve URL-only output instead of failing the whole response.
- Invalid `REQUEST_BODY_MAX_BYTES` outside `1..104857600` -> sanitized `invalid_runtime_config` response.
- Invalid `Content-Length: 01` or `+1` -> return `null` and use streamed byte accounting.
- Valid UTF-8 non-object JSON -> 400 `request body must be a JSON object`.
- Invalid UTF-8 -> 400 `invalid UTF-8 request body`.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: add `NEW_FEATURE_FLAG` to `CONFIG_ENV_KEYS` in the same change that reads it in `getConfig`.
- Base: use `requestContentLength(request)` for route-level body byte telemetry and oversized preflight checks.
- Bad: reuse `_configCacheValue` when `_configCacheEnv === env` without comparing the watched snapshot.
- Bad: build a single serialized cache key containing copies of all watched secrets on every request.
- Bad: parse `Content-Length` with `Number(raw)` and accept signs, fractions, leading-zero variants, or unsafe integers.

### 6. Tests Required

- Unit test that mutating and reusing one env object recomputes config.
- Unit test in-place mutation and growth of array-form `API_KEYS`.
- Benchmark cached reads for empty, realistic, large-secret, and maximum-secret environments.
- Unit test each new config env key through `getConfig`.
- Unit test `requestContentLength` for valid, absent, malformed, and unsafe values.
- Unit test `readJsonRequest` preflight rejection from `Content-Length`.
- Unit test streamed body cancellation when bytes exceed `maxBodyBytes`.
- Unit test multipart image edits remain independent from the JSON body limit.
- Unit test generated-image individual and aggregate overflow cancellation plus URL fallback.
- Run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:arch`, `pnpm unit`, and `pnpm smoke` after changing request parsing or config wiring.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
if (_configCacheValue && _configCacheEnv === env) return _configCacheValue;
```

#### Correct

```typescript
if (
  _configCacheValue &&
  _configCacheEnv === env &&
  _configCacheSnapshot &&
  configSnapshotMatches(_configCacheSnapshot, env)
) {
  return _configCacheValue;
}
```

## Scenario: Streaming Delta Coalescing

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing completion stream event helpers, OpenAI or Google streaming writers, SSE pacing, or small-delta performance behavior.

### 2. Signatures

- `streamPlainCompletionEvents(provider, input, { signal, coalesceTextDeltas, minCoalescedTextChars, maxCoalescedTextWaitMs })` emits completion stream events.
- `streamToolSieveCompletionEvents(...)` and `streamBufferedToolTextCompletionEvents(...)` accept the same internal coalescing options.
- `createDeltaCoalescer(sendDeltaFrame, minFlushChars = 64, maxFlushWaitMs = 20, { emitFirstImmediately })` buffers protocol deltas.
- `MIN_DELTA_FLUSH_CHARS` and `MAX_DELTA_FLUSH_WAIT_MS` are the protocol-frame defaults.

### 3. Contracts

- Completion coalescing options are internal to `src/completion/runtime.ts`; pass only provider-supported options such as `signal` into `provider.streamText`.
- With `coalesceTextDeltas: true`, emit the first provider text delta immediately, then buffer later deltas until `minCoalescedTextChars` code points, `maxCoalescedTextWaitMs`, stream end, or a non-abort stream error.
- On non-abort provider errors, flush pending text before yielding the warning/error event so partial output is preserved.
- On abort/disconnect, do not flush buffered text as a synthetic final delta and do not emit noisy stream errors.
- Protocol writers should use `createDeltaCoalescer(..., { emitFirstImmediately: true })` when user-visible streaming latency matters.
- Always await promise-returning `append(...)` or `flush()` results before writing a finish frame, switching delta fields, or closing the stream.
- Responses streaming should track accumulated output length separately from joined text so empty-output checks do not require repeated full-string concatenation.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Provider yields `["he", "llo"]` with first-immediate coalescing -> first chunk may contain `he`, later flush contains `llo`.
- Many tiny provider deltas after the first -> fewer protocol frames once buffered text reaches 64 code points or 20 ms.
- Provider throws after pending non-abort text -> pending text is emitted, then warning/error handling runs.
- Provider aborts after pending text -> stream stops without warning/error event and without forcing buffered text.
- Delta field changes from `content` to `tool_calls` -> flush `content` before buffering `tool_calls`.
- Finish frame written before `flush()` resolves -> ordering bug; await the flush.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses, and Google stream writers opt into completion coalescing and protocol-frame coalescing.
- Base: keep the first user-visible token fast while reducing high-frequency tiny writes after that.
- Bad: pass `coalesceTextDeltas` through to a provider adapter that does not understand it.
- Bad: join the whole Responses output string on every delta just to decide whether output is empty.

### 6. Tests Required

- Unit test completion coalescing for first-delta emission and later buffered emission.
- Unit test pending coalesced text flushes before non-abort stream warnings.
- Unit test `createDeltaCoalescer` flushes on field changes.
- Unit test `emitFirstImmediately` writes the first delta before throttling later deltas.
- Route or stream writer tests should assert OpenAI and Google streaming still preserve finish frames and warning behavior.
- Run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:arch`, `pnpm unit`, and `pnpm smoke` after changing stream coalescing.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
for await (const delta of provider.streamText(input, options)) {
  await write(`data: ${JSON.stringify({ delta })}\n\n`);
}
```

#### Correct

```typescript
for await (const event of streamPlainCompletionEvents(provider, input, { signal, coalesceTextDeltas: true })) {
  if (event.type === "text_delta") {
    const writeResult = coalescer.append("content", event.text);
    if (writeResult) await writeResult;
  }
}
const flushResult = coalescer.flush();
if (flushResult) await flushResult;
```

## Scenario: Attachment Dedupe And In-Flight Memory

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing request-local attachment materialization, deduplication, upload concurrency, or attachment memory limits.

### 2. Signatures

- `attachmentDedupeKeyForTest(materialized)` exposes the request-local key algorithm only to the test bundle.
- `mapWithConcurrencyAndWeight(items, concurrency, maxWeight, weightOf, mapper)` preserves input ordering while limiting item count and aggregate active weight.
- Attachment uploads use four workers and a 32 MiB normal in-flight materialized-byte budget.

### 3. Contracts

- Hash `materialized.bytes` directly. Do not prepend metadata into a payload-sized temporary buffer.
- Include normalized MIME and filename alongside the payload digest so equal bytes with different metadata remain distinct.
- Preserve pending-promise deduplication for identical concurrent attachments and preserve result order.
- Weight admission is FIFO. An item above the normal byte budget may run only when no other weighted item is active, so valid large files still make progress without weakening the normal aggregate bound.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Same bytes, MIME, and filename -> one upload and repeated ordered references.
- Same bytes with different MIME or filename -> distinct dedupe keys.
- Several items fit under 32 MiB -> run subject to the four-item limit.
- One valid item exceeds 32 MiB -> run alone; queued items resume after release.
- Mapper throws -> release its weight in `finally` so later items cannot deadlock.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: digest the existing `Uint8Array`, then format a small metadata-plus-hex key.
- Base: output arrays retain input order even when upload completion order differs.
- Bad: allocate `new Uint8Array(prefix.length + payload.length)` solely for hashing.
- Bad: reject or permanently queue a valid attachment only because it exceeds the normal aggregate budget.

### 6. Tests Required

- Unit test dedupe equivalence and MIME/filename distinctions.
- Unit test FIFO weighted concurrency, ordered results, error release, and single oversized-item progress.
- Preserve request-local pending-upload dedupe integration tests.
- Benchmark a large attachment dedupe key and compare against the former copy-based path.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
const copy = new Uint8Array(prefix.byteLength + materialized.bytes.byteLength);
copy.set(prefix);
copy.set(materialized.bytes, prefix.byteLength);
await crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", copy);
```

#### Correct

```typescript
const digest = await crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", materialized.bytes);
return `${materialized.mime}\0${materialized.filename}\0${bytesToHex(new Uint8Array(digest))}`;
```

## Scenario: Tool-Sieve Held Candidate Performance

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing `src/toolstream/index.ts`, DSML/XML tool-call parsing, streamed tool-call candidate holding, or markdown-protected tool-looking text behavior.

### 2. Signatures

- `processToolSieveChunk(state, chunk)` appends provider text and returns plain text chunks that are safe to emit.
- `flushToolSieve(state, toolsRaw)` parses any final buffered tool candidate or releases buffered text.
- `parseCanonicalDSMLToolCallsFast(text)` may parse straightforward canonical XML tool blocks before the tolerant DSML normalization path.

### 3. Contracts

- A held candidate is confirmed by a complete tool opening tag prefix, not by `isPartialToolMarkupPrefix` on the whole buffer. `isPartialToolMarkupPrefix` intentionally remains broad and can return true for complete strings that start with `<tool_calls`.
- Once a candidate is confirmed, `processToolSieveChunk` must not rescan the entire growing buffer for partial-prefix detection on every provider chunk.
- Canonical DSML fast parsing may only accept plain canonical `<tool_calls>...<invoke ...>...</invoke></tool_calls>` XML. Confusable, alias, fenced, missing-wrapper, markdown-protected, or backtick-bearing inputs must fall back to the tolerant parser.
- Malformed but real-looking tool syntax should not leak mid-stream; keep it buffered until flush unless it is proven to be ordinary stale/plain text.
- Markdown-protected examples such as fenced `<tool_calls>` snippets must be released as plain text, not held as real tool calls.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- 240 KB canonical held candidate split into 1 KB chunks -> no per-chunk full-buffer partial-prefix scan; benchmark should stay materially below the old ~25 ms median baseline.
- `<tool_calls><invoke></invoke></tool_calls>` in a held state -> remains buffered until flush.
- Fenced markdown example containing `<tool_calls>` -> released as plain text.
- Stale holding state with no tool syntax -> releases through the bounded plain-text path.
- Confusable or alias DSML -> parsed by tolerant path, not fast path.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: use a complete-opening-tag check to set `confirmedToolCandidate`.
- Base: final parsing still delegates parameter handling to existing XML/DSML helpers.
- Bad: call `isPartialToolMarkupPrefix(state.buffer)` for every chunk after a candidate has already been confirmed.
- Bad: fast-parse markdown-protected examples or confusable markup.

### 6. Tests Required

- Unit tests for canonical fast-path parsing and fast-path rejection of fenced, alias, confusable, and backtick-bearing inputs.
- Unit tests for held malformed syntax, markdown-protected examples, and stale holding state recovery.
- Benchmark `stream_sieve_held_tool` after changing held-candidate logic.
- Run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:arch`, `pnpm unit`, `pnpm coverage:ci`, and `pnpm smoke`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
if (isPartialToolMarkupPrefix(state.buffer)) return [];
```

#### Correct

```typescript
if (!state.confirmedToolCandidate && isPartialToolMarkupPrefix(state.buffer)) return [];
```
