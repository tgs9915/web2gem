# Release Workflows

> GitHub Actions and release asset guidelines for the root `web2gem` package.

---

## Workflow Layout

- `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml` runs pull request, `dev`, and `main` quality checks.
- `.github/workflows/release-artifacts.yml` is the reusable publication workflow. It builds GitHub Release assets, publishes GHCR, and can publish the same release image to Docker Hub and Aliyun.
- `.github/workflows/reusable-versioned-release.yml` owns shared version calculation, package version update, release gates, commit, tag push, and release revision output.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` is the single manual versioned-release entrypoint. It calls the reusable version workflow once, then calls the publication workflow with the captured revision.

Keep workflow names stable unless the GitHub Actions UI and README are updated together.

---

## Release Asset Contract

GitHub Releases must expose only these build artifacts plus checksum metadata:

- `worker.js`
- `web2gem_<tag>_docker_linux_amd64.tar.gz`
- `web2gem_<tag>_docker_linux_arm64.tar.gz`
- `sha256sums.txt`

Do not add bundle tarballs for `worker.js`; the raw `worker.js` asset is the Cloudflare Worker deployment artifact. Docker image archives must be split by platform and named with the `web2gem_<tag>_docker_linux_<arch>.tar.gz` pattern.

Before uploading assets, the release workflow should verify that every expected file exists and is non-empty. The upload list should stay explicit instead of relying on broad globs that can include stale artifacts.

---

## Docker Image Publishing

Docker images are named `web2gem` and are tagged with:

- the release tag, for example `v1.1.1`
- the bare package version, for example `1.1.1`
- `latest`

Docker archive assets should load into a readable local image tag, at minimum `web2gem:<tag>`. Registry images should include OCI labels for the package version and the actual release commit revision.

---

## Versioned Release Safety

Only one version-bumping registry release workflow should run at a time. Use a shared concurrency group for workflows that update `package.json`, create tags, or push version commits.

Before running expensive release gates, validate that the target tag does not already exist. If a workflow creates a version commit before publishing Docker images, capture `git rev-parse HEAD` after the commit and use that SHA for image revision labels.

Registry-specific release workflows should not duplicate the version bump / tag logic. Call `.github/workflows/reusable-versioned-release.yml` and consume its outputs:

- `new_version`
- `new_tag`
- `revision_sha`

Registry publish jobs should check out `revision_sha` before building Docker images so image labels and contents match the version commit.

## Scenario: Unified Release Publication

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing registry publication, GitHub Release assets, release workflow inputs, or Docker build reuse.

### 2. Signatures

- `release.yml` inputs: `version_type`, `publish_dockerhub`, `publish_aliyun`.
- `release-artifacts.yml` reusable inputs: `release_tag`, `revision_sha`, `prepared_revision`, `publish_dockerhub`, `publish_aliyun`.
- `reusable-versioned-release.yml` outputs: `new_version`, `new_tag`, `revision_sha`.

### 3. Contracts

- A manual release calls the version-authority workflow exactly once.
- All registry tags and release assets use the returned `revision_sha`.
- The publication workflow always publishes GHCR and may add Docker Hub/Aliyun tags when their boolean inputs are true.
- Selected registry credentials must be validated before the image build; credentials stay out of the version-authority job.
- Use one multi-platform publication build containing all requested registry tags.
- Platform archive exports use the same checked-out revision, labels, and explicit GHA cache scope.
- Keep the release-event and manual-tag entrypoints for publishing an existing tag; they run canonical release gates unless `prepared_revision` is true from the version-authority caller.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Prepared versioned release -> skip duplicate release gates, build/publish the captured revision.
- Existing tag publication -> run canonical release gates before publication.
- Docker Hub selected with missing username/token -> fail before registry login/build.
- Aliyun selected with incomplete registry/namespace/user/password -> fail before registry login/build.
- Optional registry not selected -> do not expose or use that registry's credentials/tags.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: one prepare call followed by one reusable publication call with immutable outputs.
- Base: publish GHCR, Worker asset, archives, and checksums with both optional registries disabled.
- Bad: separate Docker Hub and Aliyun workflows each bump the package version and create their own tag.
- Bad: invoke `docker/build-push-action` once per registry for the same revision.

### 6. Tests Required

- Assert `release.yml` calls both reusable workflows and contains no image build.
- Assert the publication workflow exposes the reusable inputs and contains exactly one multi-registry `docker/build-push-action` step.
- Assert the old independent Docker Hub versioned workflow does not exist.
- Assert publication and archive builds share an explicit cache scope.
- Preserve explicit asset-name and checksum validation.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```yaml
jobs:
  dockerhub:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-versioned-release.yml
  aliyun:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-versioned-release.yml
```

#### Correct

```yaml
jobs:
  prepare:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-versioned-release.yml
  publish:
    needs: prepare
    uses: ./.github/workflows/release-artifacts.yml
    with:
      release_tag: ${{ needs.prepare.outputs.new_tag }}
      revision_sha: ${{ needs.prepare.outputs.revision_sha }}
```

## Scenario: Manual Versioned Release Source

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract for any `workflow_dispatch` workflow that can update package versions, create tags, or push commits to `main`.

### 2. Signatures

- `github.ref` / `GITHUB_REF` identifies the branch or tag selected for the manual workflow run.
- `.github/workflows/reusable-versioned-release.yml` is the only workflow allowed to create the version commit and tag.
- The release checkout explicitly uses `ref: main` with `fetch-depth: 0`.

### 3. Contracts

- A versioned release must fail unless `github.ref === "refs/heads/main"`.
- Validate the source ref before checkout, dependency installation, version mutation, quality gates, tag creation, or pushes.
- Pin the checkout to `main` independently of the guard; do not rely on the workflow UI's selected ref as the release source.
- Registry-specific callers consume the reusable workflow outputs and must not push their own version commits or tags.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- `refs/heads/main` -> continue to explicit `main` checkout.
- Any feature branch -> fail with a clear source-ref error before dependency installation.
- Tag ref -> fail before version calculation or mutation.
- Missing or unexpected ref -> fail closed.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: validate `GITHUB_REF`, then use `actions/checkout` with `ref: main`.
- Base: an operator selects `main` in the manual workflow UI and the release proceeds normally.
- Bad: check out the selected ref implicitly and later run `git push origin HEAD:main`.

### 6. Tests Required

- Assert the source guard appears before checkout and dependency installation.
- Assert the guard accepts only `refs/heads/main`.
- Assert the checkout contains `ref: main` and `fetch-depth: 0`.
- Keep the canonical release-gate assertions for the reusable workflow.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v5
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0
```

#### Correct

```yaml
- name: Validate release source
  env:
    RELEASE_REF: ${{ github.ref }}
  run: test "${RELEASE_REF}" = "refs/heads/main"

- uses: actions/checkout@v5
  with:
    ref: main
    fetch-depth: 0
```

## Deterministic Quality Gates

- Generated-artifact consumers must select the artifact produced by their own build phase. Benchmarks default to `dist/worker.test.js`; coverage subprocesses use `BENCH_TEST_BUNDLE=dist-coverage/worker.test.js`.
- `pnpm check:bench` runs only the deterministic budget matrix and fails on missing, non-finite, or over-budget medians. Tune budgets only with repeated baseline evidence; do not hide regressions by gating the full noisy benchmark suite.
- `pnpm check:size` measures the production Worker bundle against the configured byte budget.
- `pnpm worker:types` generates `worker-configuration.d.ts` from `wrangler.jsonc` and `.dev.vars.example`; `pnpm check:worker-types` must reproduce it byte-for-byte.
- `WorkerBindings` contains only portable runtime vars and secret names. This edition has no database binding or persisted-account configuration.
- Worker type generation builds the main module first, uses `--include-runtime false` and `--strict-vars false`, and leaves runtime value validation to `getConfig`.

Run benchmark, bundle-size, Worker-type freshness, coverage, and smoke gates after changing generated sources, performance-sensitive code, or release scripts.

## Scenario: Isolated Docker Build Context

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, Docker smoke behavior, or files copied into container build stages.

### 2. Signatures

- `Dockerfile` build inputs: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.mjs`, `wrangler.jsonc`, `scripts/`, and `src/`.
- Safe environment templates: `.env.example` and `.dev.vars.example`.

### 3. Contracts

- Exclude `.env`, `.env.*`, `.dev.vars`, and `.dev.vars.*` from every Docker build context.
- Re-include the two committed example files after their matching wildcard exclusions.
- Exclude repository-only content such as tests, docs, reports, coverage, and release assets when it is not copied by `Dockerfile`.
- Every path copied from the repository by `Dockerfile` must remain available in the build context.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Sensitive environment file matches an exclusion -> it must not enter the context.
- Committed example matches a wildcard exclusion -> a later negation rule must re-include it.
- `Dockerfile` adds a new repository `COPY` input -> update `.dockerignore` and the context contract test together.
- Required build input becomes excluded -> the contract test must fail before a release build.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `.env.*` is followed by `!.env.example`, and `.dev.vars.*` is followed by `!.dev.vars.example`.
- Base: source, build scripts, manifests, and TypeScript configuration remain available.
- Bad: send `.env.production`, tests, coverage, or local reports to the Docker daemon.
- Bad: exclude `scripts/` or `src/` while `Dockerfile` still copies them.

### 6. Tests Required

- Assert all sensitive environment patterns and repository-only paths are excluded.
- Assert example-file negations exist after their wildcard exclusions.
- Assert every declared `Dockerfile` build input is absent from the exclusion set.
- Run `pnpm unit -- tests/unit/scripts.test.mjs`; run `pnpm docker:smoke` when container startup is authorized.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```dockerignore
.env.*
scripts
src
```

#### Correct

```dockerignore
.env
.env.*
!.env.example
.dev.vars
.dev.vars.*
!.dev.vars.example
tests
docs
```

## Scenario: Risk-Routed Pull Request Gates

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml` or the local changed-file classifier.

### 2. Signatures

- `classifyChangedFiles(files)` returns `docs` or `runtime`.
- `Classify Change Risk` exposes the boolean `runtime` job output.
- `Required Gates - Ubuntu` remains the stable aggregate required-check name.

### 3. Contracts

- Every pull request triggers the workflow and classifier.
- Only root README files, `LICENSE`, and paths under `docs/` are documentation-only; empty or unknown sets fail closed to `runtime`.
- Source, tests, scripts, package/config, Docker, workflow, and `.trellis/spec/` changes run the full Ubuntu gates and Node matrix.
- Pushes to `dev`/`main` and manual runs always classify as runtime-impacting.
- Documentation-only PRs keep the Ubuntu required job present while skipping dependency installation, coverage, benchmarks, bundle checks, and the Node matrix.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- `README.md` plus `docs/image.png` -> `docs`.
- Any `.github/`, `.trellis/spec/`, `src/`, `tests/`, or `scripts/` path -> `runtime`.
- No changed paths -> `runtime`.
- Non-PR event -> `runtime` without diff classification.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: use `git diff --name-only -z` and the repository-owned Node classifier.
- Base: preserve existing job display names and full release gates.
- Bad: skip the whole workflow for Markdown paths, leaving required checks pending.
- Bad: use a broad `*.md` allowlist that treats Trellis specs as documentation-only.

### 6. Tests Required

- Unit test representative docs-only, source, workflow, Trellis spec, test, and empty file sets.
- Contract-test the workflow classifier pipe, stable Ubuntu job, lightweight docs step, and runtime-only Node matrix.
- Run `actionlint` across every workflow file.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    paths-ignore: ["**/*.md"]
```

#### Correct

```yaml
jobs:
  classify:
    outputs:
      runtime: ${{ steps.risk.outputs.runtime }}
  ubuntu-quality:
    name: Required Gates - Ubuntu
    needs: classify
```

---

## Validation

For workflow changes, run:

```sh
git diff --check
pnpm typecheck
pnpm docker:smoke
```

Run broader checks such as `pnpm coverage:ci` and `pnpm smoke` when release gates, build scripts, Docker runtime behavior, or generated bundle behavior change.
